ðŸŒ¸ Easy 111. Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children. 

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
