"""35. Search Insert Position

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

unless exact target is found
while loop will end when right is on the left of left
since when insert, target is inserted to the right bound
return right
