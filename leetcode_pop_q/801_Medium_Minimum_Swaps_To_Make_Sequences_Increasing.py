ðŸŒ¸ Medium 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing

We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.

Example:
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
